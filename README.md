# Lip-reading-using-OpenCV-and-DL

Lip Reading using OpenCV and Deep Learning:
This repository contains code and resources for lip reading using OpenCV and Deep Learning. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately recognize spoken words from lip movements captured in video.

Requirements:
Python (3.6 or higher)
OpenCV (4.5.1 or higher)
TensorFlow (2.5.0 or higher)
Keras (2.4.3 or higher)
NumPy (1.19.5 or higher)
matplotlib (3.3.4 or higher)

Usage
Prepare the dataset: Obtain a dataset of videos containing people speaking. Each video should be labeled with the corresponding spoken word.

Preprocess the dataset: Extract the frames from the videos and crop the region containing the lips. You can use the provided preprocess.py script to automate this step.

Train the lip reading model: Run the train.py script, providing the path to the preprocessed dataset. The script will train the deep learning model using the extracted frames and their corresponding labels.

Test the lip reading model: Run the test.py script, providing the path to the trained model and a video containing lip movements. The script will process the video frames, feed them into the model, and display the recognized words.
